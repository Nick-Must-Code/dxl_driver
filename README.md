=======
# A high-level DynamixelSDK wrapper that simplifies torque control of Dynamixel actuators.
# It works surprisingly well for Dynamixel XL330-series actuators running in Current-Control Mode based on some I/O data we've collected
# that relates current commands to output torques.  For other Dynamixels, building a simple testbench, collecting some data, and running 
# a regression can get you surprisingly good results.
